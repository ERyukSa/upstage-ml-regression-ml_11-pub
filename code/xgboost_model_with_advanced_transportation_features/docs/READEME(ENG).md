## Summary of Each Section

### 1\. DATA LOADING

Loads property data, subway station data, and bus stop data from CSV files. The data includes property characteristics, geographical coordinates, and transportation information.

### 2\. FEATURE PREPARATION

Cleans and prepares the raw data by handling missing values, converting data types, and identifying continuous and categorical columns.

### 2.1 Fix Coordinates in the Main Dataset

Ensures that coordinates in all datasets follow the same convention. Fixes and standardizes the coordinate system across property, subway, and bus data.

### 2.2 Add Coordinate Standardization Function

Implements a function to standardize coordinate conventions, ensuring X = longitude (~127) and Y = latitude (~37) for proper spatial calculations.

### 2.3.1 Optimize Parallelization \[VECTORIZED\]

Sets up the parallel processing framework to handle large datasets efficiently. Defines the core function process\_transportation\_features that orchestrates the transportation feature extraction pipeline.

### 2.3.2 Advanced Vectorization

Implements optimized, vectorized versions of geographical calculations like haversine distance to improve performance when processing large datasets.

### 2.3.3 Memory and I/O Optimizations

Implements memory optimization techniques like downcasting data types to handle large datasets more efficiently with limited RAM.

### 2.3.4 Algorithm Selection Based on Dataset Size

Dynamically selects optimal algorithms and parameters based on the size of the dataset, adapting processing strategy for different scales.

### 2.4 Apply Transportation Feature Processing

Applies the optimized processing based on dataset size, deciding whether to use parallel or sequential processing.

### 2.5 Transportation Feature Integration

Runs the main transportation feature integration process, which calculates distance to nearest stations, transit scores, and other metrics.

### 2.6 Save Transportation Features

Saves processed data with transportation features to cache for future use, avoiding repeated computation.

### 2.7 Transportation Feature Visualization

Creates visualizations of transportation features, including geographic distribution, impact of subway proximity on prices, and transit score distribution.

### 3\. FEATURE ENGINEERING

Creates additional features from the base and transportation features, particularly interaction features between property characteristics and transportation accessibility.

### 4\. DATA SPLITTING

Splits the data into training and validation sets using stratified K-fold to ensure representative price distribution in each fold.

### 5\. PREPROCESSING PIPELINE

Implements preprocessing steps including feature scaling, categorical encoding, and transportation feature selection.

### 6\. MODEL TRAINING

Trains XGBoost regression models using cross-validation, tracking performance metrics for each fold.

### 7\. MODEL EVALUATION

Performs comprehensive evaluation of the model, analyzing errors, feature importance, and comparing performance across folds.

### 7.3/7.4 TRANSPORTATION FEATURE ANALYSIS

Specifically analyzes the impact and importance of transportation features on housing price prediction.

### 8\. INFERENCE ON TEST DATA

Applies the best model to make predictions on the test dataset and generates submission file.

### 9\. MODEL OPTIMIZATION WITH TRANSPORTATION FEATURES

Provides recommendations for further optimization of transportation features based on analysis results.

### 10\. TRANSPORTATION FEATURE IMPORTANCE VISUALIZATION

Creates detailed visualizations of transportation feature importance categories and rankings.

### 11\. GEOGRAPHIC PRICE PREDICTION VISUALIZATION

Visualizes predicted housing prices geographically, creating heatmaps and density plots to identify pricing patterns.

## Key Components and Functions

-   **standardize\_coordinates**: Ensures consistent coordinate systems across datasets.
-   **optimize\_spatial\_operations**: Applies vectorization optimizations to spatial calculations.
-   **select\_optimal\_algorithms**: Dynamically selects processing strategies based on dataset size.
-   **create\_distance\_bands**: Converts continuous distance measures to categorical bands for analysis.

-   **select\_important\_transport\_features**: Selects the most important transportation features for modeling.

## Future Work Recommendations

1.  **Experiment with different transportation proximity thresholds** (e.g., 800m vs 1km) to find optimal distance cutoffs.
2.  **Try different hub clustering parameters** (eps and min\_samples) to better identify transportation hubs.
3.  **Create more interaction features** between transportation metrics and high-value areas.
4.  **Test feature reduction strategies** to use only the top 5-7 most important transportation features.
5.  **Implement hyperparameter tuning** focused on transportation feature weights.
6.  **Develop neighborhood-specific transit value models** to capture how transit value differs by location.
7.  **Incorporate temporal transit data** to account for service frequency and operating hours.
8.  **Add transit line importance weighting** based on connectivity and ridership.
9.  **Explore ensemble approaches** with models specialized for different transport accessibility levels.
10.  **Implement geospatial cross-validation** to better account for spatial autocorrelation in the data.

This project effectively demonstrates how transportation accessibility metrics can substantially improve housing price prediction models, contributing 15-20% to overall feature importance.
